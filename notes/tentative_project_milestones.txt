AllDay (Working Title) Project Milestones/Goals

This is not a complete collection of goals but should serve as a guideline for
progress and what remains to be done with respect to development.

The numbering of goals is in no particular order, although some goals are
clearly dependent upon others being completed first.
Format: A#
Where A is an alphabetical character corresponding to the general category of
goal in question and # is an identifying number.
